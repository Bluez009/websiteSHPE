Using bootstrap and pingendo to do front end web design

# Purpose
Initially started as a way to revamp our Stony Brook University Chapter website but had instead used a CMS service such as Wordpress to easily update and manage its contents. 

As a result this was then led into more as a simple passion project for myself, as I was an artist growing up this tends to lead more into my creative mind in terms of designing a website. It also helped me better understand how to read and write HTML, CSS, and javascript for development.

To visually see the website without using github pages, used rawgit.com
